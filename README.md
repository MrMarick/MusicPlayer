## How It Works 

### Architecture  
This app follows the MVC Architecture (Model-View-Controller).  

### Code Breakdown  
#### 1. ViewController  
- Displays recommended songs and playlists.  
- Handles swipe gestures for carousel-like navigation in the recommended section.  
- Manages the backGroundSongView for playback controls.  

#### 2. SongListVC  
- Displays the list of songs in a playlist.  
- Allows navigation to the music player screen when a song is selected.  
- Implements play/pause and stop controls for background music playback.  

#### 3. MusicVC  
- The main music player screen with playback controls and progress tracking.  
- Uses the `MusicPlayer` singleton for music management.  
- Includes methods to:
  - Load music from a URL.  
  - Start and stop playback timers.  
  - Update UI elements dynamically based on the music's state.

## Dependencies 

This app does not require external dependencies at the moment. However, it makes heavy use of native iOS frameworks:  

- AVFoundation: For music playback.  
- UIKit: For designing the UI components.
